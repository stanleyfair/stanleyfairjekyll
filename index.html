    <p><strong style="color: #c41107">Attention: Due to the heavy rain forecast for Saturday the Stanley Fair Horse Pull is postponed to Sunday. Registration 10am to 12noon. Pull begins at 1pm.</strong></p>
    <p>A recently recovered 1946 recording for CBC radio describes the horse pull this way: “But in Stanley you hear the ring of tug hooks, pull straps and double reins for this is a horse country and the feature of the show is the horse pulling contest. Big farm teams hooked to a drag sled piled high with stone. Farmers horses driven by men of the soil.”</p>
    <p>The 200 foot long heritage barn will once again be filled with animals and displays.</p>
    <p>Inside the Root House is where all of the exhibitors’ entries will be exhibited. Expect to see examples of the best quilting, knitting, handicrafts, baking, pickles, jams, flowers, vegetables, crafts, photography, wood work, painting and children’s work.</p>

    <h3>Official Opening Dinner</h3>
    <p>Stanley Fair Opening Dinner in the Dance Hall, Stanley Fair Grounds<br/>
    Thursday 15 August<br/>
    Doors open at 6:00, Dinner served at 6:30</p>

    <p>A little history... For decades this event was known as “The Judges Dinner”. It was a formal event with invited guests including Fair judges, distinguished citizens from Fredericton and benefactors of the Stanley Fair. In recent times it has become a community dinner welcoming everyone to celebrate the opening of the Stanley Fair. Join us to celebrate the 169th Stanley Fair. The Hillcrest United Church Fundraisers will be preparing the Community Opening Dinner. This group has decades of experience preparing meals for hundreds.  That experience guarantees a delicious turkey dinner featuring local produce including home made pickles, rolls and dessert. The members of North Tay 4-H Club will be serving.  Price $14.00, children under 12 $7.00 and under 6 free. Our own Kirk MacDonald acts as Master of Ceremonies. Entertainment for the evening is the always popular Cake Auction. Kirk does double duty and steps up as auctioneer for the Cake Auction.

    <h3>Cake Auction</h3>
    <p>Once again we are holding the very popular “Celebrity* Cake Auction”<br/>
    * celebrity means you!</p>
    <p>This year the auction is scheduled for Thursday, August 15 during the Community Opening Dinner. Roast turkey dinner prepared by the Hillcrest United Church Fundraisers. This group has decades of experience preparing meals for hundreds. That experience guarantees a delicious turkey dinner featuring local produce. Price $14.00. How can you help? Donate a cake – team efforts are permitted! Your cake can be decorated (and delicious) or just delicious. In other words, if you want to use the secret family recipe – maybe one that won first prize at the Stanley Fair year after year – it doesn’t need to have fancy decoration.</p>
    <p>If you want to donate a cake please bring it to the Stanley Fair Grounds on Thursday 15 August between 10:00am and 6:00pm.</p>
    <p>OR<p>
    <p>Come to the Opening Dinner, enjoy a delicious Turkey Dinner and bid on one (or more) of the unique cakes being auctioned.</p>
