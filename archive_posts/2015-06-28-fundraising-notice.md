Greetings from the Stanley Fair Fund Raising Committee!

For 165 years the good people of Stanley and surroundings have come together to celebrate their community. In October 1851 settlers from all around gathered in “Logan’s Field” or fellowship and friendly competition. According to the “Secretary’s Report for 1851” prizes were awarded to 32 different exhibitors in a variety of areas and so began the Stanley Fair. It has been held in a few different locations but the Stanley Fair Grounds in the heart of the village has been its home for generations. The Stanley Fair has been held every year since 1851.

This longevity would not be possible without the support of devoted Agricultural Society members, community volunteers and sponsorship from the Village of Stanley, generous businesses, area service clubs and churches.

Can we count on your support this year? You can make cash donations to the general fund, donate to the specific area of the fair that is of special interest to you or donate items or products to be used as auction items or prizes. Make cheques payable to Stanley Agricultural Society #35. Please send a business card(s) or logo along with your donation to be included in our sponsor recognition display on site.

In the words of our forefathers “All roads lead to the Stanley Fair”. We hope you plan to attend this year’s Stanley Fair to experience the traditions of the past and enjoy some new and exciting events.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this request. If you have any questions, concerns, ideas or suggestions please don’t hesitate to contact Edith Dextraze 367-3068 or edextraze@xplornet.ca or any Stanley Agricultural Society member.

Regards,  
Edith Dextraze, Secretary
