Thank you!

From all of us at the Stanley Agricultural Society, THANK YOU to the Stanley area 100 WOMEN ~ making a difference!!!!

The Stanley Agricultural Society has been one of the Stanley area groups to benefit from 100 Women ~ making a difference. Over the past three years we have received nearly $6000.00! These funds have been used to make some much needed repairs to the Dance Hall roof including transforming the old steel with a fresh coat of green paint. These funds have also helped pay for some upgrades to the electrical as well as other needed upgrades and improvements. Thank you to all the women who have contributed to this local initiative. You are making a truly positive difference in our community!
