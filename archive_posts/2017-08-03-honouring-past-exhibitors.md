- Were your ancestors exhibitors at the first Stanley Fair in 1851?
- Did your grandmother win first prize for her white bread year after year?
- Maybe your grandfather grew prize winning potatoes?

Would you like to honour these past exhibitors and support the tradition of exhibiting at the Stanley Fair? In 2013 we invited people to submit names of past exhibitors. To date we have received several names and donations. The names are displayed in the Root House, among the present day exhibitors’ entries.
<!--end-excerpt-->
This is intended to be a growing list, adding names every year. To have a name added to the Honour Roll send the name to: Edie Dextraze, 367-3068 or edextraze@xplornet.ca.

We appreciate any donations made to this Honour Roll of Past Exhibitors.

Make cheques payable to the Stanley Agricultural Society.

The names of the honourees will be prominently displayed in the exhibit area in the Root House.

For more information call Edith Dextraze or email edextraze@xplornet.ca.
