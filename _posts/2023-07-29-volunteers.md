We are looking for volunteers to cover a few shifts at a variety of events throughout the fair. Would you be interested in: scooping ice cream, selling tickets, washing dishes, supervising childrenâ€™s activities, helping out in the barn, taking orders in the canteen, general cleanup, monitoring exhibits, set up of tables for dinners and pub, etc.
Shifts are approx 3 hours long or as long as you are willing to offer ðŸ™‚ Itâ€™s a fabulous place to see a lot of family and friends that you rarely get a chance to see. Please conact us if you would like more info or if you would like to volunteer.
